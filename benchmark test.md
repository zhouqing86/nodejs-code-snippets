Of course. You've brought up an excellent point about performance. For operations on multiple worksheets, running them in parallel is a great way to speed things up.

In Kotlin, while you can certainly use a `ForkJoinPool`, the more modern, idiomatic, and often simpler approach is to use **Kotlin Coroutines**. They are lightweight, efficient, and perfect for I/O-bound tasks like modifying files.

Hereâ€™s how you can create a function that uses coroutines to clear all sheets in a workbook concurrently.

### Recommended Approach: Using Kotlin Coroutines

This approach launches a new coroutine for each sheet. These coroutines can run in parallel on a thread pool, managed efficiently by the coroutine library.

```kotlin
import kotlinx.coroutines.*
import org.apache.poi.ss.usermodel.Workbook

/**
 * Concurrently clears all sheets in a workbook using Kotlin coroutines.
 * This function will return only after all sheet clearing operations are complete.
 *
 * @param workbook The workbook whose sheets are to be cleared.
 */
suspend fun clearWorkbookInParallel(workbook: Workbook) {
    // Use coroutineScope to create a scope for our concurrent jobs.
    // This ensures that the function doesn't return until all launched coroutines inside it are finished.
    coroutineScope {
        // Iterate through each sheet in the workbook.
        workbook.sheetIterator().forEach { sheet ->
            // Launch a new coroutine for each sheet.
            // We use Dispatchers.IO because sheet operations involve file I/O.
            launch(Dispatchers.IO) {
                println("Starting to clear sheet: ${sheet.sheetName}")
                // Call your existing function to clear the single sheet.
                clearSheetSafe(sheet)
                println("Finished clearing sheet: ${sheet.sheetName}")
            }
        }
    }
}
```

### How to Use It

You would call this new `suspend` function from within a coroutine context, for example, using `runBlocking` in a `main` function:

```kotlin
import org.apache.poi.xssf.usermodel.XSSFWorkbook
import java.io.FileInputStream
import java.io.FileOutputStream

fun main() = runBlocking {
    // Example: Load a workbook
    val inputStream = FileInputStream("path/to/your/workbook.xlsx")
    val myWorkbook = XSSFWorkbook(inputStream)

    println("Starting parallel sheet clearing...")
    // Call the new concurrent function
    clearWorkbookInParallel(myWorkbook)
    println("All sheets cleared.")

    // Example: Save the modified workbook
    val outputStream = FileOutputStream("path/to/your/cleared_workbook.xlsx")
    myWorkbook.write(outputStream)
    myWorkbook.close()
    outputStream.close()
}
```

### Why Coroutines are a Better Fit Here:

1.  **Lightweight**: Coroutines are much lighter than traditional threads. You can launch thousands of them without significant overhead.
2.  **Simplicity**: The code is more readable and structured. `coroutineScope` provides a clean way to wait for all tasks to complete without manual thread management.
3.  **I/O Optimization**: By using `Dispatchers.IO`, you're telling Kotlin to run this code on a thread pool specifically optimized for input/output operations, which is exactly what Apache POI does.

This approach effectively parallelizes your `clearSheetSafe` function, making it much faster for workbooks with many sheets. Let me know if you have any other questions



Of course. Here is the equivalent Gradle configuration for the Maven `pom.xml` you provided. Using a dedicated JMH plugin for Gradle is the standard practice, as it simplifies the process of running benchmarks significantly.

I will provide the configuration in both **Groovy DSL** (`build.gradle`) and **Kotlin DSL** (`build.gradle.kts`), which are the two common syntaxes for Gradle.

### 1. Gradle Configuration with Groovy DSL (`build.gradle`)

This is the most common format for Gradle projects. Create a file named `build.gradle` in your project's root directory and add the following content:

```groovy
plugins {
    id 'java'
    // JMH Gradle Plugin for easy benchmark execution
    id 'me.champeau.gradle.jmh' version '0.7.2'
}

group = 'org
.example'
version = '1.0-SNAPSHOT'

// Set the Java version
java {
    sourceCompatibility = JavaVersion.VERSION_1_8
    targetCompatibility = JavaVersion.VERSION_1_8
}

repositories {
    mavenCentral()
    // Aspose.Cells is a commercial library. You must configure a repository that hosts it.
    // This could be a local Maven repository (`mavenLocal()`) or a private company repository.
    // For example:
    // maven {
    //     url "https://your.company.repository/maven"
    // }
    // mavenLocal()
}

dependencies {
    // Apache POI
    implementation 'org.apache.poi:poi:5.2.5'
    implementation 'org.apache.poi:poi-ooxml:5.2.5'

    // Aspose.Cells
    implementation 'com.aspose:aspose-cells:24.8'

    // JMH Core Library
    implementation 'org.openjdk.jmh:jmh-core:1.37'
    
    // JMH Annotation Processor
    // This corresponds to the <scope>provided</scope> and <annotationProcessorPaths> in Maven
    jmh 'org.openjdk.jmh:jmh-generator-annprocess:1.37'
}

// JMH plugin configuration
jmh {
    // Pass JVM arguments, similar to the @Fork annotation in the code
    jvmArgs = ['-Xms2G', '-Xmx2G']
    // You can override other JMH parameters here if needed
    // warmups = 5
    // iterations = 10
    // fork = 1
}
```

### 2. Gradle Configuration with Kotlin DSL (`build.gradle.kts`)

If you prefer using Kotlin for your build scripts, create a file named `build.gradle.kts` instead:

```kotlin
plugins {
    java
    // JMH Gradle Plugin for easy benchmark execution
    id("me.champeau.gradle.jmh") version "0.7.2"
}

group = "org.example"
version = "1.0-SNAPSHOT"

// Set the Java version
java {
    sourceCompatibility = JavaVersion.VERSION_1_8
    targetCompatibility = JavaVersion.VERSION_1_8
}

repositories {
    mavenCentral()
    // Aspose.Cells is a commercial library. You must configure a repository that hosts it.
    // This could be a local Maven repository (`mavenLocal()`) or a private company repository.
    // For example:
    // maven {
    //     url = uri("https://your.company.repository/maven")
    // }
    // mavenLocal()
}

dependencies {
    // Apache POI
    implementation("org.apache.poi:poi:5.2.5")
    implementation("org.apache.poi:poi-ooxml:5.2.5")

    // Aspose.Cells
    implementation("com.aspose:aspose-cells:24.8")

    // JMH Core Library
    implementation("org.openjdk.jmh:jmh-core:1.37")

    // JMH Annotation Processor
    // This corresponds to the <scope>provided</scope> and <annotationProcessorPaths> in Maven
    jmh("org.openjdk.jmh:jmh-generator-annprocess:1.37")
}

// JMH plugin configuration
jmh {
    // Pass JVM arguments, similar to the @Fork annotation in the code
    jvmArgs.set(listOf("-Xms2G", "-Xmx2G"))
    // You can override other JMH parameters here if needed
    // warmups.set(5)
    // iterations.set(10)
    // fork.set(1)
}
```

### How to Run the Benchmark with Gradle

With the JMH plugin configured, running your benchmarks is incredibly simple.

1.  Open a terminal in the root of your Gradle project.
2.  Run the following command:

    ```bash
    // On Windows
    gradlew jmh

    // On macOS/Linux
    ./gradlew jmh
    ```

Gradle will compile your code and the benchmarks, and then the `jmh` plugin will execute them. The results will be printed to the console and also saved in the `build/reports/jmh/` directory.

To run a specific benchmark, you can pass its name as a parameter:

```bash
./gradlew jmh -Pjmh.include="FormulaBenchmark.poi_testComplexSumProduct"
```
