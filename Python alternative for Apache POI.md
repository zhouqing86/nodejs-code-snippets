You’ve got a few solid paths in Python—what’s best depends on whether you need full Excel-compatible formula evaluation, whether you can rely on Excel/LibreOffice being installed, and whether commercial libraries are acceptable.

Here’s a practical menu of options:

Open-source, runs without Excel (pure Python)
- xlcalculator (pip: xlcalculator)
  - What it does: Parses a workbook and evaluates formulas offline. Builds a dependency graph, so it can evaluate only the cells you ask for.
  - Pros: No Excel install needed, works on servers, good for repeated evaluations with changing inputs.
  - Cons: Coverage is good but not 100% of Excel (new/dynamic array functions, external links, etc. may be limited).
  - Sketch of usage:
    ```
    from xlcalculator import ModelCompiler, Evaluator

    model = ModelCompiler().read_and_parse_archive("model.xlsx")
    ev = Evaluator(model)
    # Optionally set inputs
    # ev.set_cell_value("Inputs!B2", 123)
    result = ev.evaluate("Sheet1!A1")
    ```

- pycel (pip: pycel)
  - What it does: Compiles an .xlsx into Python and lets you evaluate cells on demand.
  - Pros: No Excel needed; can be fast once compiled; evaluate only target cells.
  - Cons: Doesn’t implement every Excel function; dynamic arrays and the newest functions may be missing.
  - Sketch of usage:
    ```
    from pycel import ExcelCompiler

    xc = ExcelCompiler("model.xlsx")
    value = xc.evaluate("Sheet1!A1")
    ```

- formulas (pip: formulas)
  - What it does: Parses Excel formulas and evaluates many of them; can work with xlsx via openpyxl.
  - Pros: Mature parser; fine for many classic functions (SUM, IF, VLOOKUP, etc.).
  - Cons: Coverage gaps for newer Excel features and complex edge cases.

Use the real Excel/LibreOffice calculation engine
- xlwings (needs Excel installed; Windows/Mac)
  - What it does: Automates Excel to do the calculation. Highest fidelity, since Excel evaluates.
  - Pros: Nearly perfect function coverage and behavior; great when you need to trust results.
  - Cons: Requires Excel; not ideal for headless Linux or containers; inter-process overhead.
  - Example:
    ```
    import xlwings as xw

    with xw.App(visible=False) as app:
        wb = app.books.open("model.xlsx")
        app.api.CalculateFullRebuild()
        val = wb.sheets["Sheet1"]["A1"].value
    ```

- LibreOffice UNO (headless; Linux-friendly)
  - What it does: Uses LibreOffice Calc to recalc in headless mode.
  - Pros: No Excel license; cross-platform.
  - Cons: Setup is fiddly; API is verbose; coverage is good but not identical to Excel.

Commercial engines (fast and full-featured)
- Aspose.Cells for Python (via Java or .NET)
  - What it does: Full-featured spreadsheet engine with robust formula calculation.
  - Pros: Broad function coverage, good performance, server-friendly, supports many formats (including xlsb).
  - Cons: Commercial license.
  - Typical flow: load workbook, wb.calculate_formula(), get values, save.

If you don’t actually need to calculate (just read existing results)
- openpyxl (pip: openpyxl)
  - Read cached values if the file was already calculated by Excel/LibreOffice:
    ```
    from openpyxl import load_workbook

    wb = load_workbook("model.xlsx", data_only=True)
    val = wb["Sheet1"]["A1"].value  # cached result of formula
    ```
  - Note: This will not recalc; it only reads the last saved values.

Performance tips
- Evaluate only what you need: Libraries like xlcalculator/pycel can compute specific output cells without recalculating the whole workbook.
- Reuse the compiled model: Parse/compile once, then repeatedly set inputs and evaluate outputs.
- Avoid volatile functions (NOW, TODAY, RAND, OFFSET, INDIRECT) when possible—they force broad recalc.
- If formulas are mostly aggregations/lookups over large ranges, consider porting logic to pandas/NumPy for speed, and use Excel only for IO.

Quick guidance
- Need maximum fidelity and you’re on Windows/Mac with Excel: xlwings (or pywin32) using Excel.
- Need to run on servers/headless and want good coverage/perf: Aspose.Cells (commercial).
- Open-source, headless, and you can live with partial coverage: xlcalculator or pycel.
- You only need already-computed values: openpyxl with data_only=True.

A few clarifying questions so I can steer you to the best fit:
- OS and deployment environment? (Windows/Mac/Linux, containerized?)
- File formats you must support? (.xlsx only, any .xlsb?)
- Do you need full Excel compatibility (e.g., XLOOKUP, dynamic arrays, external links, tables)?
- Rough size/complexity of workbooks and how many cells you need to read per run?
- Are commercial libraries acceptable?

Apache POI is a Java library primarily used for working with Microsoft Office file formats like Excel, and its formula evaluation can indeed be slow for complex or large-scale spreadsheets due to its in-memory processing and Java-based implementation. If you're looking for Python alternatives to handle Excel files (reading, writing, and evaluating formulas) with potentially better performance, several libraries can serve as replacements. Below are some Python options to consider, along with their strengths and weaknesses for your use case.

### Python Alternatives to Apache POI for Excel File Processing

1. **openpyxl**
   - **Description**: A popular Python library for reading and writing Excel 2010 xlsx/xlsm files. It supports a wide range of Excel features, including formula evaluation.
   - **Pros**:
     - Pure Python, no external dependencies.
     - Supports modern Excel file formats (.xlsx, .xlsm).
     - Can evaluate formulas to some extent (via cell values after computation by Excel).
     - Actively maintained and widely used.
     - Good for manipulating Excel files programmatically (e.g., editing cells, styles, charts).
   - **Cons**:
     - Formula evaluation is limited; it relies on Excel to pre-compute formula results. Openpyxl itself does not have a built-in formula evaluation engine.
     - Performance can degrade with very large files, though it’s often faster than POI for basic operations.
     - No support for older .xls files.
   - **Use Case**: Best for scenarios where you need to read/write Excel files and can rely on Excel to handle formula calculations. If you need formula evaluation, you may need to pair it with another tool.
   - **Installation**: `pip install openpyxl`

2. **xlwings**
   - **Description**: A Python library that integrates with Microsoft Excel, allowing direct interaction with Excel instances for reading, writing, and formula evaluation.
   - **Pros**:
     - Leverages Excel’s native formula evaluation engine, which is highly optimized and supports all Excel functions.
     - Excellent for scenarios where Excel is installed on the system.
     - Supports both .xlsx and .xls files.
     - Allows automation of Excel tasks (e.g., running macros, updating formulas).
     - High performance for formula evaluation since it uses Excel itself.
   - **Cons**:
     - Requires Microsoft Excel to be installed (not suitable for server environments without Excel).
     - Windows and macOS only; no Linux support.
     - Slower for large-scale automation due to COM interop overhead.
   - **Use Case**: Ideal if you’re working in an environment with Excel installed and need robust formula evaluation or integration with existing Excel workflows.
   - **Installation**: `pip install xlwings`

3. **pandas with openpyxl or xlrd/xlwt**
   - **Description**: Pandas is a powerful data manipulation library that can read/write Excel files using engines like openpyxl (for .xlsx) or xlrd/xlwt (for .xls). It’s not a direct Excel library but excels at data processing.
   - **Pros**:
     - Extremely fast for data manipulation and analysis.
     - Can read/write Excel files using openpyxl or xlrd/xlwt as backends.
     - Supports complex data transformations that can replace formula logic in Python.
     - Great for large datasets due to its optimized in-memory processing with NumPy.
   - **Cons**:
     - No built-in formula evaluation; you’d need to implement formula logic in Python or rely on Excel for pre-computed results.
     - Limited support for Excel-specific features like formatting, charts, or macros.
     - Older .xls files require xlrd/xlwt, which are no longer maintained for newer versions.
   - **Use Case**: Best for data-heavy workflows where you can replace Excel formulas with Python logic (e.g., using pandas or NumPy for calculations).
   - **Installation**: `pip install pandas openpyxl` (or `xlrd xlwt` for .xls files)

4. **pyexcel**
   - **Description**: A wrapper library that provides a unified interface for working with various Excel file formats, using plugins like openpyxl, xlrd, or pyexcel-xlsx.
   - **Pros**:
     - Simplifies working with multiple Excel file formats (.xlsx, .xls, .csv).
     - Lightweight and easy to use for basic read/write operations.
     - Extensible with plugins for different file formats.
   - **Cons**:
     - Limited formula evaluation (depends on the underlying library, e.g., openpyxl).
     - Not as feature-rich as openpyxl or xlwings for advanced Excel features.
     - Performance depends on the backend library used.
   - **Use Case**: Good for simple Excel file processing or when working with multiple file formats in a unified way.
   - **Installation**: `pip install pyexcel pyexcel-xlsx pyexcel-xls`

5. **KoalaNLP (or similar formula evaluation libraries)**
   - **Description**: While not a direct Excel library, KoalaNLP (or similar libraries like `formulas`) can evaluate Excel-like formulas in Python, potentially replacing POI’s formula evaluation.
   - **Pros**:
     - Specifically designed for formula parsing and evaluation.
     - Can handle a subset of Excel formulas without needing Excel.
     - Lightweight and independent of Excel file formats.
   - **Cons**:
     - Limited to formula evaluation; no support for reading/writing Excel files directly.
     - May not support all Excel functions or complex formula dependencies.
     - Less mature and less widely used compared to other libraries.
   - **Use Case**: Useful if your primary concern is formula evaluation and you can handle file I/O with another library like openpyxl or pandas.
   - **Installation**: Check for libraries like `formulas` (`pip install formulas`) or similar; KoalaNLP may require custom setup.

6. **FastExcel**
   - **Description**: A newer library focused on high-performance reading and writing of Excel files, built on top of Arrow/Parquet for speed.
   - **Pros**:
     - Optimized for large datasets, potentially faster than openpyxl or POI for reading/writing.
     - Leverages Apache Arrow for efficient data processing.
     - Good for big data scenarios.
   - **Cons**:
     - Limited formula evaluation support (similar to openpyxl, relies on pre-computed results).
     - Less mature and fewer features compared to openpyxl or xlwings.
     - Still in early development, so documentation and community support may be limited.
   - **Use Case**: Suitable for high-performance read/write operations on large Excel files, but you’d need to handle formula evaluation separately.
   - **Installation**: `pip install fastexcel`

### Recommendations Based on Your Needs
- **If formula evaluation is critical**:
  - Use **xlwings** if you have Excel installed, as it leverages Excel’s native engine for the best formula evaluation performance and compatibility.
  - Pair **openpyxl** or **pandas** with a formula evaluation library like `formulas` if you need a pure-Python solution without Excel dependency.
- **If performance with large files is the priority**:
  - Consider **FastExcel** for reading/writing large datasets, combined with pandas for calculations.
  - Pandas is also excellent for large-scale data processing, replacing Excel formulas with Python logic.
- **If you need a general-purpose replacement for POI**:
  - **openpyxl** is the closest equivalent to Apache POI in Python for working with modern Excel files, offering a balance of features and performance, though formula evaluation is limited.
  - **pyexcel** can be a simpler alternative for basic tasks across multiple formats.

### Example Workflow
If you’re replacing Apache POI’s formula evaluation, you could:
1. Use **openpyxl** to read the Excel file and extract cell data.
2. Use **formulas** or custom Python logic (e.g., with NumPy/pandas) to evaluate formulas.
3. Write results back to the file with **openpyxl** or **FastExcel**.

Example (using openpyxl and formulas):
```python
import openpyxl
from formulas import compile_formula

# Load workbook
wb = openpyxl.load_workbook('example.xlsx')
ws = wb.active

# Example: Evaluate a simple formula
formula = "=SUM(A1:A10)"  # Assume this is the formula in a cell
compiled = compile_formula(formula)
result = compiled({ 'A1': 1, 'A2': 2, ..., 'A10': 10 })  # Provide cell values
ws['B1'] = result  # Write result back to cell

# Save workbook
wb.save('output.xlsx')
```

### Notes
- **Formula Evaluation**: Most Python libraries (except xlwings) lack robust formula evaluation compared to Excel. If complex formulas are a bottleneck, consider pre-computing them in Excel or implementing logic in Python.
- **Performance Testing**: Test these libraries with your specific dataset, as performance varies based on file size, formula complexity, and system environment.
- **Dependencies**: Ensure compatibility with your Python version and environment (e.g., xlwings requires Excel, FastExcel requires Arrow).

If you have specific requirements (e.g., file size, formula complexity, or whether Excel is available), let me know, and I can tailor the recommendation further! Would you like me to provide a sample code for any of these libraries or focus on a specific use case?
